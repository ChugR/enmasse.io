EnMasse is an elastic messaging platform running on OpenShift with focus on scalability and 
performance. EnMasse can run on your own infrastructure or in the cloud, and simplifies the 
deployment of messaging infrastructure.

EnMasse is based on open standards like [AMQP](http://amqp.org/) and [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/), and 
open source projects like [Apache ActiveMQ Artemis](https://activemq.apache.org/artemis/), [Apache Qpid Dispatch Router](https://qpid.apache.org/components/dispatch-router/index.html) and finally the [Vert.x](http://vertx.io/) toolkit for some of its components.

EnMasse is a great fit for IoT cloud infrastructure, and aims to extend protocol support to both
HTTP and CoAP.
