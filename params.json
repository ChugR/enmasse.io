  "body": "The EnMasse project provides the required tools and services for deploying and running a scalable messaging service on [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/). Running on Openshift means that you can either run EnMasse on your own cluster locally or in the cloud. You can also run EnMasse on [Openshift Origin](https://www.openshift.org/), which is the upstream community project.\r\n\r\nEnMasse uses the [Qpid Dispatch Router](https://qpid.apache.org/components/dispatch-router/index.html), a high performance AMQP message router, in order to scale to a large number of clients and messages. For store-and-forward semantics, EnMasse uses message brokers such as [Apache ActiveMQ Artemis](https://activemq.apache.org/artemis/). \r\n\r\nSome long-term goals for EnMasse:\r\n   * Support different communication patterns like request-response, pub-sub and events\r\n   * Support for a variety of different protocols like AMQP, MQTT, HTTP(1.1 & 2), CoAP and STOMP\r\n   * Multi-tenancy\r\n   * Scalability\r\n   * Elasticity without service interruption\r\n   * Simple setup and management of messaging clusters\r\n\r\nEnMasse itself consists of infrastructure components that makes deployment and scaling easier. Here are some of the parts that make up EnMasse:\r\n   * A simple configuration format encapsulating details of message brokers and routers. The configuration can be split into a cluster admin config and application developer config.\r\n   * A set of templates for creating brokers manually or automatically based on a single configuration.\r\n   * A set of agents running as part of the cluster and acts on changes to the configuration\r\n      * Configures the router network.\r\n      * Generates and starts brokers for addresses marked as store-and-forward and attaches volumes for persistence.\r\n   * Templates for quickly setting up EnMasse on Openshift.\r\n\r\nThe project is still in it's infancy, so there are currently a lot of TODO items that are being worked\r\non in addition to the occasional bugfixing:\r\n\r\n   * Supporting more message brokers (currently ActiveMQ and ActiveMQ Artemis only)\r\n   * Stabilizing configuration format\r\n   * Downscaling brokers for topics without loosing messages\r\n   * Scalability and performance testing\r\n\r\nTo get started, you must have an openshift project setup. Use either [Openshift Online](https://www.openshift.com/) to run it in the cloud, or [Openshift Origin](http://openshift.org) if you want to run the community edition yourself. Once you have a project setup, have a look at [Setting up EnMasse](https://github.com/enmasseproject/openshift-configuration#setting-up-enmasse) for how to setup a messaging service.",
