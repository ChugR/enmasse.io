  "body": "EnMasse aims to provide the required tools and services for deploying and running a messaging service on [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/). Running on Openshift means you can either run EnMasse on your own cluster locally or in the cloud. You can also run EnMasse on [Openshift Origin](https://www.openshift.org/), which is the upstream community project.\r\n\r\nSome highlights of what EnMasse is:\r\n   * A configuration format encapsulating details of brokers and routers\r\n      * Separates cluster admin and application developer roles\r\n   * A set of agents running as part of the cluster and acts on changes to the configuration\r\n      * Configures the Qpid Dispatch Router cluster network\r\n      * Generates and starts broker clusters for each address marked as store-and-forward and attaches volumes for persistence\r\n   * Templates for quickly setting up a messaging cluster on Openshift\r\n\r\nThe project is still in it's infancy, so there are currently a lot of TODO items that are being worked\r\non in addition to the occasional bugfixing:\r\n\r\n   * Supporting other brokers (currently ActiveMQ and ActiveMQ Artemis only)\r\n   * Supporting topics (only queues supported at the moment)\r\n   * Stabilizing configuration format\r\n   * Downscaling brokers without loosing messages\r\n   * Scalability and performance testing",
