    <section class="main-content">
      <p>EnMasse aims to provide the required tools and services for deploying and running a messaging service on <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">Openshift</a>. Running on Openshift means you can either run EnMasse on your own cluster locally or in the cloud. You can also run EnMasse on <a href="https://www.openshift.org/">Openshift Origin</a>, which is the upstream community project.</p>

<p>Some highlights of what EnMasse is:</p>

<ul>
<li>A configuration format encapsulating details of brokers and routers

<ul>
<li>Separates cluster admin and application developer roles</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A set of agents running as part of the cluster and acts on changes to the configuration

<ul>
<li>Configures the Qpid Dispatch Router cluster network</li>
<li>Generates and starts broker clusters for each address marked as store-and-forward and attaches volumes for persistence</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Templates for quickly setting up a messaging cluster on Openshift</li>
</ul>

<p>The project is still in it's infancy, so there are currently a lot of TODO items that are being worked
on in addition to the occasional bugfixing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Supporting other brokers (currently ActiveMQ and ActiveMQ Artemis only)</li>
<li>Supporting topics (only queues supported at the moment)</li>
<li>Stabilizing configuration format</li>
<li>Downscaling brokers without loosing messages</li>
<li>Scalability and performance testing</li>
</ul>
