        <p>The EnMasse project provides the required tools and services for deploying and running a scalable messaging service on <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">Openshift</a>. Running on Openshift means that you can either run EnMasse on your own cluster locally or in the cloud. You can also run EnMasse on <a href="https://www.openshift.org/">Openshift Origin</a>, which is the upstream community project.</p>

<p>EnMasse uses the <a href="https://qpid.apache.org/components/dispatch-router/index.html">Qpid Dispatch Router</a>, a high performance AMQP message router, in order to scale to a large number of clients and messages. For store-and-forward semantics, EnMasse uses message brokers such as <a href="https://activemq.apache.org/artemis/">Apache ActiveMQ Artemis</a>. </p>

<p>Some long-term goals for EnMasse:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support different communication patterns like request-response, pub-sub and events</li>
<li>Support for a variety of different protocols like AMQP, MQTT, HTTP(1.1 &amp; 2), CoAP and STOMP</li>
<li>Multi-tenancy</li>
<li>Scalability</li>
<li>Elasticity without service interruption</li>
<li>Simple setup and management of messaging clusters</li>
</ul>

<p>EnMasse itself consists of infrastructure components that makes deployment and scaling easier. Here are some of the parts that make up EnMasse:</p>

<ul>
<li>A simple configuration format encapsulating details of message brokers and routers. The configuration can be split into a cluster admin config and application developer config.</li>
<li>A set of templates for creating brokers manually or automatically based on a single configuration.</li>
<li>A set of agents running as part of the cluster and acts on changes to the configuration

<ul>
<li>Configures the router network.</li>
<li>Generates and starts brokers for addresses marked as store-and-forward and attaches volumes for persistence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Templates for quickly setting up EnMasse on Openshift.</li>
</ul>

<p>The project is still in it's infancy, so there are currently a lot of TODO items that are being worked
on in addition to the occasional bugfixing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Supporting more message brokers (currently ActiveMQ and ActiveMQ Artemis only)</li>
<li>Stabilizing configuration format</li>
<li>Downscaling brokers for topics without loosing messages</li>
<li>Scalability and performance testing</li>
</ul>
